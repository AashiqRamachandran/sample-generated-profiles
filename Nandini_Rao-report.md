10. I experience discomfort in my neck or back when working for long periods on coding projects or troubleshooting technical issues: Nandini's work involves extensive screen time, leading to frequent discomfort. Data engineering often requires long hours of focused work at a computer.
11. When working remotely or in makeshift home offices, I feel physical discomfort (neck, back, wrists) and it is worsened by the lack of ergonomic equipment: The lack of a proper ergonomic setup at home always worsens her physical discomfort. This is a common issue for remote workers in India, and Nandini's "always" answer reflects this reality.

19. When faced with back-to-back meetings, followed by technical work that requires focus, I often rely on energy drinks or coffee to regain concentration: The need to switch between meetings and focused technical tasks occasionally requires stimulants for better concentration. The occasional nature reflects the ability to manage focus reasonably well.
20. When working from home, I often find myself checking emails or messages outside of my official work hours: The occasional blurring of boundaries between work and personal time is common, especially with the demands of a data analyst role. This is a common challenge in today's always-on work environment.
